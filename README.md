## About this Application
Our target consumers are those who are either new players to Magic the Gathering, or veteran players that are interested in a quick refresher on the game. The reason that anyone would like to use our product is to learn more about the abilities of the Magic the Gathering cards. You have different cards with different “Creatures,” “Spells,” “Enchantments,” “Artifacts,” and our application will show and describe the abilities, keywords, and overall breakdown of each card. Our application will hold all of the information that is needed to start playing Magic the Gathering, as well as a card database, and a glossary for any keyword. Each card will have basic stats, skills, a card type, and card cost. This app is designed to have one location for all the cards to easily and efficiently find a card that a player may want to learn more about. It will also contain a rulebook with a glossary, and a quick start guide.
